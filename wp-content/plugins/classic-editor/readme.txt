Restores the Classic Editor and the old-style Edit Post screen layout (TinyMCE, Meta boxes, etc.). Supports the plugins that extend this screen.

== Description ==

Classic Editor restores the previous WordPress editor and the Edit Post screen and makes it possible to use the plugins that extend it, add old-style meta boxes, or otherwise depend on the previous editor.

By default it will hide all traces of the new Gutenberg editor including the Dashboard widget asking the users to try it.

It has two modes:

1. Fully replaces the Gutenberg editor and restores the Edit Post template.
2. Adds alternate "Edit" links to the Posts and Pages screens, on the toolbar at the top of the screen, and in the admin menu. Using these links will open the corresponding post or page in the Classic Editor.

The modes can be changed from the Settings -> Writing screen. See the screenshots.
